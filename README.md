☁️ Week 10 Project Completed – Weather App (OpenWeather API) 🌦️🌍

Super excited to share my Week-10 project — a fully functional Weather App built using React (Vite), Tailwind CSS, and the OpenWeather API! ❄️⚛️

This project helped me understand real-time data fetching, API error handling, state management, and building a clean UI with reusable components.

Built as part of my learning journey at Error Makes Clever (EMC) using the EMC Tutorial, under the guidance of Agnel John (Founder & Instructor) and with support from Nandhini (Co-Mentor).

✨ Project Highlights :

✅ Search and Fetch Weather by City Name
✅ Real-Time API Integration
✅ Error Handling (Invalid city, failed request etc.)
✅ Dynamic Weather Icons from OpenWeather
✅ Temperature, Pressure, Humidity & Wind Speed
✅ “Feels Like” Temperature Indicator
✅ Responsive UI with Tailwind
✅ Clean and Minimal Design
✅ Reusable Components (SearchBar, WeatherCard)

🧠 What I Learned :

~ This project helped me gain practical knowledge in:

Working with external APIs using Axios

Managing and updating component state

Building reusable UI components

Handling loading states and error responses

Using environment variables for API keys

Making responsive UI using Tailwind CSS

Accepting user input and using it dynamically in API calls

🧩 Tech Stack :

⚛ React (Vite)
🎨 Tailwind CSS
🌍 OpenWeather API
📦 Axios
🔧 Environment Variables (VITE)

📂 Project Structure & Features :

🔎 SearchBar Component :

~ Takes city name input
~ Calls API function passed as props
~ Clears input after search

🌤️ WeatherCard Component :

~ Displays temperature, country, humidity, wind, pressure
~ Shows weather condition icon and description dynamically
~ Clean UI layout with responsive design

⚙️ How It Works :

~ fetchWeather() calls the OpenWeather API
~ useState stores loading, error, and weather response data
~ API key stored securely in .env file
~ WeatherCard renders only if valid data is received
~ Handles city not found & network errors
